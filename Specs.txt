Modular architecture.
Modules providing override of a class have greater priority than the override folder.
If 2 or more modules provide override of the same class the last installed will be used.

---------config file-------------
first include "defines.php" file
define autoload functions
call Authenticate class

---------Create page-------------
Every page file must start with including of the "config/config.php" file
Then call the Display() method of its child of the Page class

--------The Page class-----------

The Display() method is the only public method
It runs 3 private methods sequently - ProcessData(),Header(),Html();
